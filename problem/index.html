  <h1 style="color: white; text-align: center; padding: 50px; text-decoration: underline;">737 Max Summary</h1>
  <div class="column1">
  <li style="color: white; padding: 50px; font-size: 20px;"> This all started when the Airbus A320neo got announced. The A320neo would consist of bigger engines which consist of 15% more fuel efficiency as well as more silent engines. Boeing was trying to compete with this but there was a problem. The airbus a320 had a higher gear suspension meaning they could fit a bigger engine under the wing with ease, but Boeing had lower gear suspension meaning they couldn’t. Boeing’s solution was placing the engine ABOVE the wing. However there was a problem, if you go 100 percent thrust in the new max, the plane would tend to pitch up over the SAFE ZONE which can lead to a stall. Boeing’s solution was to install software(M.C.A.S.) on the aircraft forcing the elevators to pitch the plane down. The Boeing 737Max was supposed to act as the same as the 737-800 to make pilot training funding less, so Boeing did not mention M.C.A.S. on the handbook. This is where the catastrophic problem starts. First pilots start reporting to Boeing that their plane was suddenly nosing down. Then 2 major crashes happened within a year of the same aircraft, Lion Air Flight: 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight: 302. Reports of the 2 crashes show that the plane was getting false sensor data from the MCAS forcing the planes to nose down into the ground and pilots did not know how to turn it off since it was not mentioned in the handbook. Boeing later then grounded ALL 737Max aircraft because they got exposed for rushing certification with the FAA. Basically to solve the problem of rushing to compete, is to NOT rush aircraft production as well as provide training for the newer software, having this advantage can lead to pilots being able to turn off the software if it malfunctions.</h1>
