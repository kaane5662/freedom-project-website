  <p style="color: white; padding: 50px; font-size: 20px;"> Ever since the A320-Neo got announced, Boeing was left at a cliffhangar. The A320neo would consist of bigger engines which consist of 15% more fuel efficiency as well as more silent engines. Boeing was trying to compete with this but there was a problem. The airbus a320 had a higher gear suspension meaning they could fit a bigger engine under the wing with ease, but Boeing had lower gear suspension meaning they couldn’t. Boeing’s solution was placing the engine ABOVE the wing. However there was a problem, if you go 100 percent thrust in the new max, the plane would tend to pitch up over the SAFE ZONE which can lead to a stall. Boeing’s solution was to install software(M.C.A.S.) on the aircraft forcing the elevators to pitch the plane down. The Boeing 737Max was supposed to act as the same as the 737-800 to make pilot training funding less, so Boeing did not mention M.C.A.S. on the handbook. This is where the catastrophic problem starts. First pilots start reporting to Boeing that their plane was suddenly nosing down.

    <li style="padding: 30px; color: white;">The fatal crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last year was caused by systemic design flaws in the Boeing 737 Max that were compounded by flight crew lapses, Indonesian investigators told the relatives of victims on Wednesday.</a>

<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12">
  <p style="color: white; padding: 50px; font-size: 20px; margin-top: px;">Then 2 major crashes happened within a year of the same aircraft, Lion Air Flight: 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight: 302. Reports of the 2 crashes show that the plane was getting false sensor data from the MCAS forcing the planes to nose down into the ground and pilots did not know how to turn it off since it was not mentioned in the handbook. Boeing later then grounded ALL 737Max aircraft because they got exposed for rushing certification with the FAA. Boeing was starting to completley lose their reputation from it's own customers and services. People who were scheculed to board a 737 Max fled in terror and tried to change their flight. </h1>

    <li style="padding: 30px; color: white;">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed near Addis Ababa one year ago Tuesday. The crash have been attributed to a faulty automated flight-control system called MCAS.</a>
